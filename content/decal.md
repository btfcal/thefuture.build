# Why take our DeCal?

Build The Future [believes](/about#mission) in using a collaboration-driven approach in teaching students about entrepreneurship. Our course is not just a speaker series nor lecturing. We have created an intimate environment for students to learn from other students supplemented by our student facilitators’ and guest speakers’ experiences. The Build The Future DeCal is unlike any classroom experience at Cal.

# Curriculum

Our curriculum has been carefully crafted by Build The Future DeCal facilitators and reviewed by faculty at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. Over 13 weeks, the course covers 10 core topics that we believe to be essential tools and knowledges all entrepreneurs must keep in mind. 

{{< decal/curriculum >}}

In a given week of the course, students come together for two sessions: one session with a guest speaker and introduction to that week’s core topic and a second session reflecting and discussing that week’s topic with a smaller group of students in the class.

You can find our syllabus [here](/media/syllabus_f20.pdf).
